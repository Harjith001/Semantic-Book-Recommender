## Data Cleaning

Effective data cleaning is crucial for the accuracy of the recommendation system. The `data_cleaning.py` module is responsible for:

- **Handling Missing Values**: Ensuring that incomplete data does not affect the model's performance.
- **Removing Duplicates**: Eliminating redundant entries to maintain data integrity.
- **Standardizing Formats**: Consistent formatting of text, such as titles and author names, to ensure uniformity.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning textual data by removing special characters, stop words, and applying stemming or lemmatization.

These steps ensure that the dataset is clean, consistent, and ready for modeling.

## Models Used

The recommendation system utilizes advanced natural language processing (NLP) models to understand the semantic content of books:

- **Word Embeddings**: Techniques like Word2Vec or GloVe are employed to represent words in a continuous vector space, capturing semantic relationships.
- **Transformer-Based Models**: Models such as BERT or RoBERTa are used to generate contextual embeddings, allowing the system to understand the context and nuances of book descriptions.

These models enable the system to capture the semantic meaning of book content, facilitating more accurate recommendations.

## Vector Search

To efficiently find and rank similar books, the system implements vector search techniques:

- **Embedding Generation**: Each book's description is converted into a fixed-size vector using the trained NLP models.
- **Similarity Measurement**: Cosine similarity or other distance metrics are used to measure the closeness between book vectors.
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Data structures like KD-Trees or libraries such as FAISS are utilized to perform fast nearest neighbor searches, enabling real-time recommendations.

This approach ensures that users receive recommendations that are semantically similar to their preferences.

## Usage

To use the Semantic Book Recommender:

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare your dataset of book descriptions and metadata.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Use the `data_cleaning.py` module to preprocess the data.
3. **Model Training**: Train the NLP models using the cleaned data.
4. **Vector Search Setup**: Index the book vectors using the vector search methods.
5. **Recommendation**: Input a book description to receive a list of semantically similar books.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Harjith001/Semantic-Book-Recommender.git
   cd Semantic-Book-Recommender
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the necessary Python libraries by running:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn torch transformers faiss-cpu
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the necessary scripts to clean data, train the model, and perform recommendations.
